# TorChat-V0.9.9.x

Future version 0.9.9.555 - (historical)

version 0.9.9.554 - 30-Jun-2015 (unpublished)
- issue: new windows installations cannot connect to recent Linux installations
- fix: update the tor package for windows
- side-effect: updated wxPython to V3.0
- windows: update the bundled tor.exe to current stable version 0.2.6.9
- many changes in code, some cosmetic, some preparation work for the 1.0.0.1 release 
  which shall consist of migrating from Python 2.x to Python 3.4.3

Publication 0.9.9.554 - 24-Feb-2019
- unreleased copy of this version had limited circulation within a reddit working group. 
  This (working) version is being published in the hope that it will be found useful,
  however, this version contains a very serious security issue with the file transfer that
  is being addressed in the soon to be published V0.9.9.556. 
  The file transfer starts immediately upon the sender clicking send. Meaning that a user
  who is not paying attention could be the recipient of a malicious file. (Think of the 
  evidence a government agent could plant exploiting this hole....) Only use this version 
  with people you know & trust.
- windows: update the bundled tor.exe to current stable version 0.3.5.7

version 0.9.9.553
- Last update from  Bernd Kreuss <prof7bit@gmail.com>     Copyright (c) 2007-2010 
- Bernd is working on a port to Pascal, so I understand his lack of interest in supporting this.
-  That said, the original TorChat was a brilliant piece of software and it would be a shame
-  to let it die.
