# TorChat-V0.9.9.x
Working updates to the Original TorChat.

Future version 1.0.0.1 - Planned release for Python V3 


Future version 0.9.9.556 (soon)
- file transfer from older versions blocked by default. The potential for unwanted file fragments 
  to be deposited on your computer by a malicious actor is extremely serious.
  (last thing you want is a government actor dropping "evidence" on you to be "found" later)
- Configuration option added to completely disable file transfers.


version 0.9.9.555 - 12-Jul-2015 (unpublished)
- Migrated the buddylist.txt to the more flexible buddylist.ini 
- Allows chat window size and positioning to be retained on a per-buddy basis.
- re-arranged buddy-list context menues to make logical groupings.
- Offline message notification flasher
- Clean-up help about and btc tip-jar 
- fixed URL copy to clipboard

Publication 0.9.9.555 - 26-Feb-2019
- unreleased copy of this version had limited circulation within a reddit working group. 
  This (working) version is being published in the hope that it will be found useful,
  however, this version contains a very serious security issue with the file transfer that
  is being addressed in the soon to be published V0.9.9.556. 
  The file transfer starts immediately upon the sender clicking send. Meaning that a user
  who is not paying attention could be the recipient of a malicious file. (Think of the 
  evidence a government agent could plant exploiting this hole....) Only use this version 
  with people you know & trust.
- windows: update the bundled tor.exe to current stable version 0.3.5.7

version 0.9.9.554 - 30-Jun-2015 (unpublished)
- issue: new windows installations cannot connect to recent Linux installations
- fix: update the tor package for windows
- side-effect: updated wxPython to V3.0
- windows: update the bundled tor.exe to current stable version 0.2.6.9
- many changes in code, some cosmetic, some preparation work for the 1.0.0.1 release 
  which shall consist of migrating from Python 2.x to Python 3.4.3

version 0.9.9.553
- Last update from  Bernd Kreuss <prof7bit@gmail.com>     Copyright (c) 2007-2010 
- Bernd is working on a port to Pascal, so I understand his lack of interest in supporting this.
-  That said, the original TorChat was a brilliant piece of software and it would be a shame
-  to let it die.
